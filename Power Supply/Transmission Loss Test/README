This folder shows the test and calculations for the transmission losses through the convertor when the power supply is 
supplying (12v .15amps) which is the max draw of the highest intensity system in the project (Mateo's camera/microcontroller system)

Conclusion: When supplied (12v .15amps) the load draws from the convertor (5v .261amps) compared to the ideal draw (5v .36amps)
This gives a power loss of 27.5 which validates the power loss requirement of <30% losses.
