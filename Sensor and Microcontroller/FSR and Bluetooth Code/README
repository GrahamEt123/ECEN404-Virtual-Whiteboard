This folder has the code used on the microcontroller attached to the glove. It allows us to send values from the pressure sensor to the central device which for us is another microcontroller. One sensor determines the intensity of pressure applied in a percentage to determine the thickness of a stroke. The other sensor determines if the user wants to do a left click or right click.
