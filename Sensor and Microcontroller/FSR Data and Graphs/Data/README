This data shows the FSR value compared to the pressure being applied to them. A voltage divider was utilize by adding a 10k Ohm resistor so that the other values
could be calculated. The ADC is the analog voltage value that the microcontroller reads depending on the Vo value. the ADC value ranges from 0-1023. In the data
I also added the ADC percentage as well as a fixed percentage. The ADC percentage shows that it reads almost 80% of values within the first 15% of pressure applied. This is why the fixed percentage was created. The fixed percentage lets us manipulate the pressure being applied so that we can gradually increase while staying 
consistent with the pressure applied to the sensor. How I did this is shown in the code I created.
