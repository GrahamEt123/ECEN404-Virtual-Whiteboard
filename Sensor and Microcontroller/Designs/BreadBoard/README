The BreadBoard design was used for the majority of testing. It produced most of the data found and contributed to creating the graphs presented in the other folder. I 
introduced a voltage divider used for the FSR and evaluated data produced from the sensor. This allowed me to develop the code utilized for this subsystem, including 
reading the register values, which was necessary to determine which sensor was activated.
